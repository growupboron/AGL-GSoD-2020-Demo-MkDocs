# Controller

* Object: Generic Controller to handle Policy,Small Business Logic, Glue in between components, ...
* Status: Release Candidate
* Author: Fulup Ar Foll fulup@iot.bzh
* Date  : May-2018

## Features

* Create a controller application from a JSON config file
* Each control (eg: navigation, multimedia, ...) is a suite of actions. When all actions succeed control is granted, if one fails control access is denied.
* Actions can either be:
  * Invocation of an other binding API, either internal or external (eg: a policy service, Alsa UCM, ...)
  * C routines from a user provided plugin (eg: policy routine, proprietary code, ...)
  * Lua script function. Lua provides access to every AGL appfw functionality and can be extended by plugins written in C.

## Installation

* Controller can easily be included as a git submodule in any AGL service or application binder.
* Dependencies: the only dependencies are AGL application framework (https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/p/src/app-framework-binder.git) and app-afb-helpers-submodule (https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/p/apps/app-afb-helpers-submodule.git).
* Controller relies on Lua-5.3, when not needed Lua might be removed at compilation time.

## Monitoring

* The default test HTML page expect the monitoring HTML page to be accessible under /monitoring with the --monitoring option.
* The monitoring HTML pages are installed with the app framework binder in a subdirectory called monitoring.
* You can add other HTML pages with the alias options e.g. afb-daemon --port=1234 --monitoring --alias=/path1/to/htmlpages:/path2/to/htmlpages --ldpaths=. --workdir=. --roothttp=../htdocs
* The monitoring is accessible at http://localhost:1234/monitoring.
